# ðŸ”„ 16-bit Barrel Shifter in Verilog

A simple yet powerful **16-bit Barrel Shifter** implemented in Verilog. This design supports **both left and right shifts**, offering fast and efficient data shifting â€” perfect for CPUs, ALUs, and digital signal processing applications.

## ðŸš€ What is a Barrel Shifter?

A **barrel shifter** is a combinational circuit that shifts data by a specified number of bits **in a single operation**. Unlike traditional shifters that shift one bit at a time, barrel shifters use a series of multiplexers to achieve this instantly, regardless of the shift amount.

This project includes a 16-bit barrel shifter that can perform:
- **Left shift**
- **Right shift**

With clean modular design and reusable components.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ barrel_shifter.v       # Top-level module
â”œâ”€â”€ mux_2_1.v              # 2-to-1 multiplexer (used in construction)
â”œâ”€â”€ mux16_1.v              # 16-to-1 multiplexer (used for shift logic)
â””â”€â”€ barrel_shifter_tb.v    # Testbench for simulation
